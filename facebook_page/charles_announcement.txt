SGT LEADER is, understandably, the boss. He and his team of bounty hunters have been in long pursuit of Celestia, who's thwarted them at every turn. This time with the help of some illegal tech, things will be different... or will they?

We're excited to announce that @BBC Casualty​' Charles Venn will be playing the role of Sgt Leader in DISABLE/ENABLE!
